# Module Seven Challenge Report

## Project Overview
---
The aim of this analysis is to determine the number of retiring employees per title, and identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program.

## Results
---
These are four major points that need to be highlighted:

- Most of the retirees are from senior positions like senior staff and engineers (from the figure below).

- The number of people retiring is large as more than 30000 employees are going to leave the company (from the figure below).

- Managers are valued in the company and they need them which explains the low number of retirees from management positions (from the figure above).
- Most of the employees for the mentorship program are in senior positions and lots of experience (from the figure below).

## Summary
---
- The total number of roles that need to be filled so that the silver tsunami make an impact is 90398 positions. Each title will need at least the counted number of retirees in the retiring titles table. 
- the number of the employees in the mentorship program is 1549 which is small compared to the positions that will be filled which is 90398 and I believe that there will be need for more people to train the unexperienced staff. 
- To understand better the needed number of trainers, it will be better if the mentorship_eligibilty table is grouped by title and counted as well to have a clearer idea about the scenario. In addition to that, a query to create a table containing information about the retired employee and the departments where they were working is alson needed for the managemnt to allocate resources accordingly.
