# Module Seven Challenge Report

## Project Overview
---
The aim of this analysis is to determine the number of retiring employees per title, and identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program.

## Results
---

These are four major points that need to be highlighted:

- Most of the retirees are from senior positions as senior staff and engineers. 
- The number of people retiring is large as more than 30000 employees are going to leave the company. 
- Most of the employees for the mentorship program are in senior positions and lots of experience. 
- Managers are valued in the company and they need them which explains the low number of retirees from management positions.
